JABB
====

Just Another Barebones Base is a BYOND-based MUD
showcasing the use of a variety of different libraries that I've written for
BYOND. Together they provide a strong suite from which to create a MUD.

Why should you be using JABB?
-----------------------------
JABB is meant to be a demonstration, or a base from which you can create your own
MUD. It will primarily appeal to those looking to start from scratch,
those new to programming, or those who find the rapid development pace of writing
something in BYOND appealing.
